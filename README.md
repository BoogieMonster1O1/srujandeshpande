## Hello there. Welcome to my Profile! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Srujan a developer, student and perpectual learner. Check out my portfolio [here](https://srujandeshpande.tech)!

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on multiple projects. One of them is a Cloud based Air Quality Visualization Platform. Working on some more stuff, but they're a secret ðŸ¤« for now!
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning React, MongoDB, Django and Electron! Have to say, Python and JavaScript are the best ðŸ˜Ž
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about Flask, MongoDB, DevOps, Blockchain and Google Cloud Platform. They're my favourite!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot an email to srujan@deshpande.tech!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been coding _every single day_ for the last **17 weeks**. It's great fun!
